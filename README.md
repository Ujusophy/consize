**The automated safety engine for cloud cost optimization.**

Cloud infrastructure teams waste 30–50% of their compute and database spend not because they lack visibility, but because the operational risk outweighs the potential savings.

**Consize exists to close that gap.** It is a fully automated safety engine that analyzes your infrastructure, applies rightsizing changes in small steps, verifies the safety of those changes in real-time, and automatically rolls back if things go wrong.

---

## How is Consize different from Kubecost?

[Kubecost](https://www.kubecost.com/) is a phenomenal open-source project and the absolute gold standard for Kubernetes cost observability and allocation. If your goal is to map cloud billing data to specific namespaces or cross-charge teams, you should use Kubecost.

However, observing waste and **fixing waste safely** are two different problems. 

Consize compliments the ecosystem by focusing entirely on safe, automated action. While observability tools provide recommendations for engineers to apply manually, Consize acts as an active safety net: it generates rightsizing IaC PRs, executes changes in small steps, and monitors your SLIs (e.g., latency, OOM kills) in real-time. If an application degrades, Consize triggers an automated rollback. 

---

## Try the Interactive Sandbox

The fastest way to experience Consize's safety net is through our **Interactive Sandbox**. It runs entirely on your local machine using a single Docker container, pre-seeded with historical data, cloud waste opportunities, and a live metrics simulation.

```bash
# Pull and run the all-in-one interactive sandbox
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 -it ghcr.io/consize-oss/consize-sandbox:0.2.0
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You can watch the Verifier catch an intentional regression on the `checkout-api` workload and instantly trigger an automatic rollback to restore safety.

## Production Installation

Consize is built to run safely inside your cluster. It uses read-only access for analysis and requires explicit, least-privilege, namespace-scoped `RoleBindings` before it can apply any changes.

Install Consize onto a live cluster (AWS and GCP currently supported) using our official Helm chart hosted on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):

```bash
# 1. Export the default values to customize your installation
helm show values oci://ghcr.io/consize-oss/charts/consize > values.yaml

# 2. Install the chart using your customized values
helm install consize oci://ghcr.io/consize-oss/charts/consize \
  --version 0.2.0 \
  --namespace consize-system \
  --create-namespace \
  -f values.yaml
```

## Configuration

For detailed instructions on configuring Helm values, setting up Service Accounts, and providing Integration Secrets, please refer to this **[Installation Guide](docs/customer-guide.md#installation)**.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Kubernetes Rightsizing** | Deterministic CPU & Memory p95/p99 usage analysis over 14-day windows. |
| **Cloud Waste Scanning** | Automatically detects unattached EBS volumes, Elastic IPs, and stopped Compute instances (AWS/GCP). |
| **IaC Integration** | Clean up waste directly through the UI or automatically generate PRs against your GitOps repos (Terraform/YAML). |
| **Step-wise Apply** | Large changes are never applied at once; they are broken down into smaller, safe increments. |
| **Auto-Rollback Guardrails** | Monitors SLIs (OOMKills, CPU throttling) after every change. Breaching a threshold triggers an instant, byte-identical rollback. |

## Contributing

Consize is completely open for contribution! We build with the community, not just for the community. 

Whether it's adding support for new cloud providers, fixing bugs, or improving documentation, we welcome all contributions. 

- **Good first issues:** Look for the `good first issue` label on our issue tracker to get started.
- **Design proposals:** For larger architectural changes, please open a GitHub Discussion first. We use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant decisions.
- **Local Development:** Check out the [Architecture & Data Flow](docs/architecture.md) documentation to understand how the components fit together before spinning up your local environment.
